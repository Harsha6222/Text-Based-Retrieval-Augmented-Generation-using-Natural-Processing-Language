Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field[1] that uses
statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods , processes,
algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate know ledge and
insights from potentially noi sy, structured, or unstructured data.[2]
Data science also integrates domain know ledge from the unde rlying
application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology,
and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described
as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a
workflow, and a profession.[4]
Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis,
informatics, and their related methods " to "unde rstand and analyze
actual phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories
drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
statistics, computer science, information science, and domain
know ledge.[6] However, data science is different from computer
science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth
paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that
"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data
deluge.[7][8]
A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical know ledge
to create insights from data.[9]
Data science is an interdisciplinary field[10] focused on extracting know ledge from typically large data sets
and applying the knowledge and insights from that data to solve problems in a wide range of application
domains. The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing
data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad
range of application domains. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information
science, mathematics, data visualization, information visualization, data sonification, data integration,
graphic design, complex systems, communication and business.[11][12] Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on
Ben Fry, also links data science to human–computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control
and explore data.[13][14] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management,
statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging founda tional
professional communities.[15]Foundations
Relationship to statisticsMany statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another
name for statistics.[16] Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on
problems and techniques unique to digital data.[17] Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative
data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images,
text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action.[18] Andrew
Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a non- essential part of data science.[19]
Stanford professor David Donoho  writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of
datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and
statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field
growing out  of traditional statistics.[20]
In 1962, John Tukey described a field he called "data analysis", which resembles modern data science.[20]
In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, C. F. Jeff Wu used the term
"data science" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics.[21] Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics
symposium at the University of Montpellier  II acknow ledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on
data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data
analysis with computing.[22][23]
The term "data science" has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur propos ed it as an alternative name
to computer science.[6] In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first
conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.[6] However, the definition was still in flux. After
the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 C. F. Jeff Wu again sugge sted that
statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed
inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonym ous with accounting or limited to describing data.[24] In
1998, Hayashi Chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data
design, c ollection, a nd analysis.[23]
During the 1990s , popul ar terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly
large) included "know ledge discovery" and "data mining".[6][25]
In 2012, technologists Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil declared "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the
21st Century",[26] a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the New York
Times[27] and the Boston Globe.[28] A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that "the job is more in
demand than ever with employers".[29]
The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S.
Cleveland.[30] In a 2001 paper, he advoc ated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas;
because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name.[25] "Data science" became
more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology
launched the Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched The Journal of DataEtymology
Early usage
Modern usageScience.[25] In 2014, the American Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining
changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant
popul arity of data science.[31]
The professional title of "data scientist" has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008.[32]
Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report "Long-Lived Digital Data
Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century", it referred broadly to any key role in
managing a digital data collection.[33]
There is still no consensus on the definition of data science, and it is considered by some to be a
buzzword.[34] Big data is a related marketing term.[35] Data scientists are respons ible for breaking dow n big
data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations
determine optimal operations.[36]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of data management and analysis,
but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an
interdisciplinary field that involves the application of statistical, computational, and machine learning
methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the
examination and interpretation of  data to identify patterns and trends.[37][38]
Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or
solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as data cleaning, data visualization, and exploratory
data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypot heses about relationships between variables.
Data analysts typically use statistical methods  to test these hypot heses and draw conclusions from the data.
For example, a data analyst might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make
recommendations for marketing strategies.[37]
Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and iterative process that involves working with larger,
more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods  to analyze. Data
scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to
build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to statistical analysis, data science often
involves tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. For instance, a data
scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior
patterns and us ing machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences.[38][39]
While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by
incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data
scientists are often respons ible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques,
and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, computer
science, and domain expertise to solve complex problems and unc over hidden patterns in large datasets.[38]
Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar
skill sets. Both fields require a solid founda tion in statistics, programming, and data visualization, as well as
the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Moreover,
both fields benefit from critical thinking and domain knowledge, as unde rstanding the context and nuances
of the data is essential for accurate analysis and m odeling.[37][38]
In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconne cted disciplines within the broader
field of data management and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing
conclusions from structured data, while data science involves a more comprehensive approach thatData Science and Data Analysiscombines statistical analysis, computational methods, and machine learning to extract insights, build
predictive models, and drive data-driven decision-making. Both fields play vital roles in leveraging the
power of data to unde rstand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various
domains.
